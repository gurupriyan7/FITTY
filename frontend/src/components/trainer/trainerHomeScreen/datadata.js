Diabetes, cholesterol, eating disorder last but not the least depression were the side effects of it.

I was doubtful as I had dedicatedly in the past tried all the diets and fancy workouts which failed to show any sustainable results ever. ‘Getting shredded’ document altered my perception of weight loss, it sounded logical, sustainable and it appealed my core. The transformation posts on the page gave me the required booster to give one last shot."
